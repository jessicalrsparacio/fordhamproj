## How to judge a neighborhood?

```
When considering a place to book an Airbnb, it's important to consider many of the qualities
that make each neighborhood a good place to live, with some exceptions. Generally, because airbnb's
usually indicate a short stay in a specific neighborhood, most of the qualities which make a
neighborhood desirable in the long-term can be ignored (good schools, good doctors, best for retirees).
On the other hand, there's an emphasis on benefits that can be appreciated in the short-term, such as
safety and accessibility to local attractions. One feature which is more complicated is the cost of living,
because, while price is important, we must still consider the demand for luxury visits, which are more
desirable in a short-term destination (which Airbnb specializes in) than an actual living situation.
```
_**Three most important factors:**_

1. Safety (low crime rate)
2. Transportation (accessibility to & reliability of public transportation, ease of parking)
3. Attraction/Activities (availability of local attractions and recreational activities such as
restaurants, parks, etc.)

_**How Fordham fares:**_

_Fordham → Overall Grade: **B**_

1. _Safety:_ C (Higher crime rates than the national average in most major categories,
excluding robbery.)
2. _Transportation:_ B+ (Access to public transportation is widely available.)
3. _Attractions/Activities:_ A- (Reviewers describe a wide variety of parks, restaurants,
and other local attractions to enjoy.)

## And... Some Statistics!!

### _When regarding Fordham as a borough in which to rent an Airbnb, it is interesting to visualize some of its qualities._

**1. Visualizing Price Distribution**

```
This graph helps to visualize the values found using the describe funciton. Additionally, a box plot provides a median, which is helpful because it does not take into consideration the outliers which are included in the data, and can skew the mean. The median price per night is approximatley $60/ night, which is less than the mean of $69/night. The maximum price (not including outliers) is $125/night, while the absolute maximum is $225/night. Most values lean toward the lower end of the price points. 

```

**2. Visualizing Room Types**

```
We can see that there is a strong majority of Private Rooms available, followed by entire
home/apartments, and finally shared rooms.

```
## Correlational Reasearch

### _After seeing some trends in price and room types, it is interesting to attempt to find  correlations between price and other factors. We can used scatter plots to draw these conclusions._

**1.  Latitude Vs. Price**

```
The trendline reveals that there is, in fact, at least a slight positive correlation between price and increasing latitude. This is surprising, because I would think that prices would increase the closer the location is to NYC. It is possible that increasing in latitude does not exactly correspond with moving farther North from the city.
